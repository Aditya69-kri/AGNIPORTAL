# AGNIPORTAL
AGNIPORTAL helps all the agniveers to access their information easily.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Agnipath Scheme is a tour of duty style scheme introduced by the Government of India on 14 June 2022, for recruitment of soldiers below the rank of commissioned officers into the three services of the armed forces. All recruits will be hired only for a four year period. Personnel recruited under this system are to be called Agniveers, which will be a new military rank.

Agniveers face many challenges in keeping a track of their basic information like their monthly salary, hikes in salary, job apportunities after their 4 year job span,freebies, health status etc., as accessing them from the offline sources is very difficult and time consuming.

The solution to the problem is to develop a portal or a web site that will automate the operations of the Agniveers databases . The portal will be developed using C++ programming language, and it will provide an easy-to-use interface for the staff to perform their daily tasks.

We aim to develop a web portal which will aid agniveers in their daily life challenges and save their valuable time. It will also help Agniveers seeking job opportunities after their military service to help them find new jobs and explore new opportunities for their future endeavours.
